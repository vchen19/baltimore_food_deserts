# baltimore_walk_score_and_income

## Introduction
According to a study performed by the [Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future](https://clf.jhsph.edu/about-us/news/news-2015/1-4-baltimore-residents-live-food-desert), nearly 1 in 4 Baltimore residents live in areas with limited access to healthy foods, or areas commonly known as food deserts. Factors like distance to the nearest food store, poverty level, and healthy food availability index are considered when designating a community a food desert. Furthermore, racial disparities exist in food insecurity, with 34% of Baltimoreâ€™s Black residents living in such areas compared to only 8% of white residents. For policymakers, it will be important to understand how various factors relating to living in a food desert can impact life outcomes. This project is concerned with determining how factors that designate a community a food desert relate to life expectancy.

## Business question

How do healthy food availability, walk score, and income predict life expectancy?
